# PAHs in Titan's Atmosphere

[The Repository is a Work in Progress!]
This repository contains code and data for my MSc thesis project focused on analyzing Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the upper atmosphere of Titan. The project utilizes various spectral fitting techniques such as Non-Negative Least Squares (NNLS), Monte Carlo simulations, and Normalized Local Change (NLC) methods to identify and quantify PAHs using data from the NASA Ames PAH IR Spectroscopic Database and Cassini observations.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to:
1. Detect and characterize PAHs in Titan’s atmosphere using data from Cassini/VIMS and other relevant instruments.
2. Analyze PAH populations through spectral fitting techniques to improve our understanding of Titan’s complex organic chemistry and potential prebiotic conditions.
3. Develop and refine methodologies for spectral matching and analysis, including NNLS, Monte Carlo fitting, and NLC.

## Key Components:
### Data:
- Cassini VIMS-IR and CIRS observational data.
- Expanded NASA Ames PAH IR Database for spectral matching.

### Methods:
- NNLS Fitting: Used for fast, non-negative fitting of spectral data.
- Monte Carlo Simulations: Applied to explore uncertainties and probabilistic fitting.
- NLC Method: Utilized for robust spectral matching that minimizes sensitivity to noise and baseline shifts.

### Objectives:
- Investigate how PAHs form and evolve in Titan’s atmosphere.
- Correlate PAH concentrations with the atmospheric composition and conditions observed by Cassini.
- Publish findings in a comprehensive thesis and contribute to the ongoing research on Titan's atmosphere.
